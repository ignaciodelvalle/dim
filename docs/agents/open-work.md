# Open work and milestones — snapshot 2026-08-28

Companion to `docs/agents/collaborating-writer.md`. That page is the contract
(how to work); this page is the board (what is left).

**This file goes stale.** It was written against `a3ec504c5`. Before trusting a
row, check it against the code — the repo's own history is full of boards that
were confidently wrong. Where a row says "measured", it was verified on the date
above and nowhere since.

## Where the project is

MiMAR is **published on Google Play, internal testing track**, since 2026-08-27.
Real testers are installing it. That single fact reorders everything below: a
gap a tester hits today outranks a gap that is architecturally more interesting.

The active initiative is the **native parity loop** — every capability a pet
owner has on the web, brought to `apps/mobile`. The authoritative inventory is
the gap matrix in engram, topic `native/owner-gap-matrix` (~95 owner
capabilities across 79 `app/(app)` pages, 28 public citizen pages, 6 auth pages,
70 action files, 354 use-cases). The live dashboard is the "Paridad del Dueño"
artifact, which the PO keeps updated.

## Milestones

| Milestone | What it means | State |
|---|---|---|
| **M6** | "A citizen installs the app and registers their pet" — install → sign up → sign in → register → credential + QR + offline cache → owner's pet view → health record → lost mode → share → P2P transfer → temporary caretaker | **Parity side complete.** No parity box gates M6 any more. |
| M6 remainder | What still gates the launch is **not** parity: build 6 must replace the broken build 5 on Play, and the Data Safety form must match the binary | PO-gated, see below |
| M7+ | The six remaining parity clusters (WU-P/R/S/T/U/V). None gates launch — the web already serves all of them | open |

## Open work an agent can pick up

Ordered by what a live tester hits first, not by size.

| # | Work | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Edit pet identity** (name, breed, colour, markings) + **emergency contacts** + **vet** — native screens | M | The three walls testers hit first. No native module needed. `apps/mobile/app/` is expo-router; there is no edit screen of any kind today. The web serves both; reuse its guards — edit identity is **titular-only** on the web, match that exactly. |
| 2 | **Pet photo** — native image picker | M | Server side is **done**: signed upload → private bucket → `confirm` re-authorizes, verifies magic bytes, re-encodes, then writes to the public bucket. Only the picker is missing — which needs a native module, so an EAS build. That pipeline cost 6 builds / 5 distinct root causes. **Not a first task.** |
| 3 | **WU-R** — rest of account: edit profile, ARCO privacy, native account-deletion screen | M | Deletion is reachable today via a link to `/cuenta/privacidad` (satisfies Play policy); the PO wants a native screen. |
| 4 | **WU-S** — appointments: search, book, my appointments, cancel, check-in QR | L | Not in the web nav either; deep links only. |
| 5 | **WU-U** — adoption: catalogue, detail, apply, my applications | M | The application flow earns its own rate limit here. |
| 6 | **WU-V** — camera scan + confirm chip + claim | M | |
| 7 | **WU-T** — citizen abuse reports | M | Attachments blocked on signed uploads. **Not the same thing as reporting content** — this is Ley 14.346, nine types, routed to an authority. |
| 8 | **WU-P** — rehoming, foster, return, relocation, org memberships | L | Advanced custody cycle. |
| 9 | `auth_signup_ip` — 15 signups/hour per gateway | S | Breaks a plaza signup drive for citizens **without an account**: twenty new people behind one cell tower, five get locked out. Needs its own derivation — there is no per-account anchor to copy. |
| 10 | Animated card flip on the native profile | S | The two-faced profile shipped with an instant swap, which is exactly the path the web takes under reduced-motion. The animation (~485ms, one face painted at a time) is the follow-up. |

Also not done from the phone, each its own slice: correct species, rabies
appointment, physical tag, printable lost poster, health-record export,
assistance dog (Ley 26.858), attaching a photo to an entry, and five entry types
(tattoo, microchip replacement, bite, death, post-adoption check-in — the app
writes 11 of 16). Reminders are read-only rows: no "snooze 7 days", no "record".

## Declared debts, with an owner

| Debt | Weight | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| The **21 tables** the Ley 25.326 fence revealed | open | Owner notes on appointments, reminder titles, foster proposal notes, org invitation emails **in plaintext**. We closed five gaps and found twenty-one. Named, printed on every run, ratcheted in both directions. |
| A tester crash is unreadable | no instrument | R8 does **not** run in this app (verified in the Expo template), so Play's warning names nothing. But a tester's crash will be JavaScript: measured on the shipped `.hbc`, three of six local functions keep their names and three don't, no source map ships, and there is no crash reporter. |
| Two band tints outside the contract | small | **Pregnancy** and **memorial** use colours absent from `@dim/contract/tokens`, so the shared contract does not carry the web's full palette. They fall back to the default tint and the chip still says what is happening — no information lost, but it is debt in the shared layer. |
| Two files parked in the art.16 fence | small | `caretaker-public-contact.ts` and `app/page.tsx`, each with a rationale recorded in the fence. |
| Checksum drift on migration `0188` | pre-existing | Someone edited that migration **after** applying it. The database is fine; the record of what was applied is not. |

## PO-gated — not agent work, do not attempt

Listed so you recognise them and hand them over instead of trying.

1. Upload **build 6** to Play. Build 5 is published and **cannot sign in** — it shipped without `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`, which are baked at build time.
2. Revise the **Data Safety** form before any build with uploads reaches Play. It declared on 27/08 that the app does not collect photos; that stops being true the moment uploads ship, and a form that no longer matches the binary is a policy violation by itself.
3. Apply migrations **0205, 0206, 0207** to staging and production. Written and green locally. **Applying to a remote DB is Ignacio's call, never yours.**
4. Resend email setup (domain verification → API key → SMTP in Supabase → env in Vercel). Until it lands, the 6-digit password-recovery code does not travel and the screen promises what the mail does not deliver.
5. The two store graphics, pointing `mimar.com.ar` at Vercel, the tester acceptance link, the Supabase "exceeding limits" warning, and the 12 tester emails.

## Two live hazards, today

- **16 open PRs are based on the dead `main` tip** (14 dependabot + one July draft + one June docs). They will show phantom conflicts. Leave them; closing or rebasing them is the PO's call.
- **Something started a merge of the old `main` into the working tree on 2026-08-28** and aborted it, leaving conflict markers in `package.json` for a few minutes. Root cause unknown; there are 9 agent worktrees registered. If you see an unexplained `UU` or a `reset: moving to HEAD` you did not run, stop and audit before editing.

## Docs whose headers lie

`docs/superpowers/README.md` is the spec/plan index and its body is useful, but
its top banner is **stale**: it names an active branch (`integration/session-review`),
a working copy path (`C:\dim`) and a test count (6511) that no longer exist. Read
the tables, ignore the banner. Older initiative docs — the master integrity plan
(Ola II) and the Ola 1 batch plan — date from July and may or may not still be
live; ask before picking work from them.

## Branch topology — changed 2026-08-28

`main` **is the working branch.** You commit and push to it directly. It is the
same commit as `integration/all-20260703`, CI triggers on push to it (`ci.yml`:
`push: branches: [main, develop, "integration/**"]`), and the six scheduled
fences finally execute today's tree instead of a frozen one.

Protection is deliberately thin so ordinary work needs no PR dance: no required
PR, no blocking status checks, `required_linear_history` off (the worktree flow
generates merge commits by design). What stays on: the branch cannot be deleted
and cannot be force-pushed. Those two cost nothing on a normal push and are the
only ones that save you from a bad day.

**CI on `main` is advisory, not blocking — and that moves the burden onto you.**
The real gate is local: `pnpm verify` + `pnpm test:verified`, the Definition of
Done in `/CLAUDE.md`. Nothing on the server will stop you from pushing red. Do
not let that mean what it does not: the green local gate is still required, it
is simply no longer enforced by a machine at the last moment.

### Open follow-up: `DEPLOY_REF` still points at the integration branch

`scripts/check-scheduled-fence-refs.ts` declares
`DEPLOY_REF = "integration/all-20260703"`, and eleven `ref:` pins across six
workflows follow it. Those pins exist because `main` used to be three weeks
stale — they force a scheduled run to check out real code instead of the frozen
default branch.

That reasoning is now inverted, and the pins will re-create the original bug in
mirror image the moment `integration/all-20260703` stops moving. **This is not
fixed yet**, because it depends on something outside the repo: staging deploys
from `integration/all-20260703` on Vercel, and `db-doctor-staging` and
`staging-health` compare a tree against *that deployment*. Repointing the pins
before Vercel's deploy branch moves would break them in the other direction.

Sequence, once the PO decides: Vercel staging deploy branch → `main`, then
`DEPLOY_REF` → `main`, then the eleven pins can be deleted outright (a scheduled
`actions/checkout` with no `ref:` already checks out the default branch). Do not
do any one of those steps alone.
